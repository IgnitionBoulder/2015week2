##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?<br>  
Front-end development deals with the parts of the webisite that you can see and interact with, and backend development stores and organizes the underlying data.  It uses an application to interface with the frontend, but it resides on a server. 
Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?
There are multiple backend development languages so you have to tell your computer that you are going to create applications using Ruby.  HTML and CSS are universally recognized.  The coding output is rendered as a web page and will appear as long as you have a web interface and bandwidth.

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

What is an "interpreted" language?<br>  
a language where the code is not in the native language of the machine but is interpreted by an installed program
What is IRB?<br>  
a read-eval-print loop/interactive programming enviroment that can be used for testing Ruby code by executing commands from individual users
What are Objects?<br>  
objects are the building blocks of ruby code.  They're kind of like nouns, in that adjectives and verbs can easily be turned in to nouns so that other nouns can interact with them.  So everything can be an object and objects do things to objects via methods.
What are Methods?<br>  
methods are the way that objects interact with eachother
What are Classes?<br>  
groups of object bundled together by funcionality or similar characteristics
What are Blocks?<br>  
The only type of code in Ruby that is not an object.  It can't be stored in a variable. They are a way of grouping  
statements and envoking methods in certain contexts
What is an Array?<br>  
a list of elements
What is an Iterator?<br>  
a method that repeatedly envokes a block of code
What are hashes?<br>  
a collection of key value pairs, from which values can be retrieved by way of their keys.  They are often called associative  arrays or dictionaries as they are essentially lists of words(or keys) and defenitions (or values)
What is a library?<br>  
a collection of command line utilities that help increase Ruby functionality in a certain area
What is a gem? 
The main place where Ruby Libraries are hosted

Do the challenges at http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0.

Do the RubyMonk “Ruby Primer” course: http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`

####Optional & Resources
 - Read and complete the [Ruby in 100 minutes guide](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby\_in\_100_minutes.html)
 - [Ruby beginners guide](https://hackhands.com/beginners-guide-ruby/)
 - Do the first Ruby exercise (Bob) on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) and respond to any
   feedback you receieve.  Provide a link to your submission on
   Exercism.
