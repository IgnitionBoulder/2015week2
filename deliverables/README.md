##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development? 
Front-end dev is visible to the user and is the interface inviting the user to interact with. Front-end is the bridge connecting the design and the back-end dev. Back-end dev is the brain of the app. It interacts with the server to return user ready results. Helps give what the user wants to acheive by interacting with a data base. 

Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?
Ruby is back-end development and needs to be downloaded cuz it only be coded in a terminal and not in real time. The brower already knows how to interact with HTML/CSS so dont you need to install an interpreter. Ruby on the otherhand is a program that it doesnt know how to read so you have to install the ruby interpreter.

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

Sign Up for Cloud9 and create a basic Rails project.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

What is an "interpreted" language? 
An interpreted language is a programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.

What is IRB?
An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a committee established to review and approve research involving human subjects. The purpose of the IRB is to ensure that all human subject research be conducted in accordance with all federal, institutional, and ethical guidelines.

What are Objects?
Objects are instances of the class. They are created using methods under a certain class. 

What are Methods?
Methods are classes you create that have objects in them. Ruby methods are used to bundle one or more repeatable statements into a single unit. Method names should begin with a lowercase letter. If you begin a method name with an uppercase letter, Ruby might think that it is a constant and hence can parse the call incorrectly.
What are Classes?
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created

What are Blocks?
Blocks are a way of grouping statements. Can be done with braces or with 'do and end'

What is an Array?
Ruby arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index.Ruby arrays can hold objects such as String, Integer, Fixnum, Hash, Symbol, even other Array objects. 

What is an Iterator?
Iterators are nothing but methods supported by collections. Objects that store a group of data members are called collections. In Ruby, arrays and hashes can be termed collections. Iterators return all the elements of a collection, one after the other. The each iterator returns all the elements of an array or a hash.


What are hashes?
A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" => "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.

What is a library?
Libraries are archives of code that people can install and use to code. Basically adding a larger dictionary to there iterator. 

What is a gem?
Ruby gems is a packaging system designed to facilitate the creation, sharing and installation of libraries. A gem is just installing a new library. 

Do the challenges at http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0.

Do the RubyMonk “Ruby Primer” course: http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`
