##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development? 
Front-end dev is visible to the user and is the interface inviting the user to interact with. Front-end is the bridge connecting the design and the back-end dev. Back-end dev is the brain of the app. It interacts with the server to return user ready results. Helps give what the user wants to acheive by interacting with a data base. 

Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?
Ruby is back-end development and needs to be downloaded cuz it only be coded in a terminal and not in real time. The brower already knows how to interact with HTML/CSS so dont you need to install an interpreter. Ruby on the otherhand is a program that it doesnt know how to read so you have to install the ruby interpreter.

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.
