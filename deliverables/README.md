##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?<br>
Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

Sign Up for Cloud9 and create a basic Rails project.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

**What is an "interpreted" language?**<br>
An interpreted language is a programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instrucitons. 

**What is IRB?**<br>
Interactive Ruby Shell, or interactive Ruby files

**What are Objects?**<br>
Objects are individual components or instances of a class

**What are Methods?**<br>
Methods are used to bundle one or more repeatable statements into a single unit.

**What are Classes?**<br>
A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created. 

**What are Blocks?**<br>
A block consists of chunks of  code enclosed within braces. 

**What is an Array?**<br>
An array is an ordered, integer-indexed collection of any object. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index.

**What is an Iterator?**<br>
Iterators are methods supported by collections, which are objects that store a group of data members.

**What are hashes?**<br>
A hash is a collection of key-value pairs. A hash is similar to an array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of object type, not an integer index.

**What is a library?**<br>
a collection of implementations of behavior, written in terms of a language, that has a well defined interface by which behavior is invoked.

**What is a gem?**
Gems contain package information along with files to install


Do the challenges at http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0.

Do the RubyMonk “Ruby Primer” course: http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`

####Optional & Resources
 - Read and complete the [Ruby in 100 minutes guide](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby\_in\_100_minutes.html)
 - [Ruby beginners guide](https://hackhands.com/beginners-guide-ruby/)
 - Do the first Ruby exercise (Bob) on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) and respond to any
   feedback you receieve.  Provide a link to your submission on
   Exercism.
