###Intro to Ruby
####Required

What is an "interpreted" language?<br> It is a language that doesn't need a compiler to read and write.
What is IRB?<br> Interactive Ruby Shell, it allows you to write and test Ruby from a terminal.
What are Objects?<br> A data structure that makes up nearly everything: variables, numbers, arrays, lambdas, procs, other than things like blocks.
What are Methods?<br> What objects call upon in other objects to communicate with each other.
What are Classes?<br> Classes are structures that hold behavior and state.
What are Blocks?<br>A block is a contained bit of code that can't be stored in a variable, but can be stored in a proc and lambda, can only be called upon once per argument, and isn't an object.<br>
What is an Array?<br> An array is used to store a list of values in a single variable, indices start at 0, can store numbers, strings, booleans, other arrays.
What is an Iterator?<br> Something that can be changed within a loop which signifies what instance the loop is at. 
What are hashes?<br> A set of keys and values similar to a dictionary with the word being the key and the value the definition unlike in arrays, the keys can be things other than numbers. They use {} instead of [].
What is a library?<br>A library is something you can require in your program that includes collections of classes and methods.
What is a gem?<br> A gem is a software package that contains a package Ruby application or library to help with the functionality of your code and the code of other Ruby users.
