##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
**What is the difference between front- and back-end development?**<br>
Front-end development is the part of the code that is  usually visible to the user in the form of an interface. The main purpose of the front-end code is to interact with user, as well as present the data in a well-defined style and matter. Front-end developers use coding languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. These developers code what the designer creates.<br> The Back-end developer will then make that page or application functional. Meaning while the fron-end interacts with the user, the back-end interacts with the server. Back-end code uses languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, or .Net. This connects it with the database to look up, save or change data and return it back to the user in form of front-end code.

**Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?**<br>
The front-end languages HTML and CSS live in the browser so there's no extra installations required because you can run them from any machine that can access the browser. Back-end languages like Ruby do require you to install them on your computer in order to get them running becuase you need to be able to access the server you are using.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

**What is an "interpreted" language?**<br>
An interpreted language is a programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instrucitons. 

**What is IRB?**<br>
Interactive Ruby Shell, or interactive Ruby files

**What are Objects?**<br>
Objects are individual components or instances of a class

**What are Methods?**<br>
Methods are used to bundle one or more repeatable statements into a single unit.

**What are Classes?**<br>
A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created. 

**What are Blocks?**<br>
A block consists of chunks of  code enclosed within braces. 

**What is an Array?**<br>
An array is an ordered, integer-indexed collection of any object. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index.

**What is an Iterator?**<br>
Iterators are methods supported by collections, which are objects that store a group of data members.

**What are hashes?**<br>
A hash is a collection of key-value pairs. A hash is similar to an array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of object type, not an integer index.

**What is a library?**<br>
a collection of implementations of behavior, written in terms of a language, that has a well defined interface by which behavior is invoked.

**What is a gem?**<br>
Gems contain package information along with files to install


Do the challenges at http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0.

Do the RubyMonk “Ruby Primer” course: http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`

####Optional & Resources
 - Read and complete the [Ruby in 100 minutes guide](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby\_in\_100_minutes.html)
 - [Ruby beginners guide](https://hackhands.com/beginners-guide-ruby/)
 - Do the first Ruby exercise (Bob) on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) and respond to any
   feedback you receieve.  Provide a link to your submission on
   Exercism.
