##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?<br>
Front end devolopment deals with the things that the user can interact with within a website.
Back end devolopment deals with the things that the user changes through interacting with what is made by front end devolopment.
Examples being databases, servers or an application.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

What is an "interpreted" language?<br>
A programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without touchin a compiler. Thus the interpreter executes the program through each statment  of one or more subroutines already compiled into machine code. 

What is IRB?<br>
Stands for "interactive Ruby" and is a tool to interactively execute Ruby expressions read from the standard input. This is usually accessed through the terminal.

What are Objects?<br>
Objects in programming in real life. Things with specific attributes that make them distinct. Objects are usally an instance of a class or a struct depending on your langugae. 

What are Methods?<br>
A method is a programmed procedure that is defined as part of a class and included in any object of that class. 

What are Classes?<br>
Classes are a group of attributes that desbribe a general group of objects. For example a class would be a Bicycle and the attrubtes one would use to distinguish their specific objects might be it's cadence, speed or gear. 

What are Blocks?<br>
Instructions between curly braces which may optionally take arguments and returns values.

What is an Array?<br>
Arrays are ordered integer collections of any object or data types.

What is an Iterator?<br>
An iterator is a method that repeatedly invokes a block of code. 

What are hashes?<br>
hashes are collections of any object or data types. Unlike an array hashes don't use numeric indices that don't go in order from 0 to the length of the hash. Instead a hash uses a collection of key-value pairs.

What is a library?<br>
A libraries are a collection of precomplied routines that a program can use.

What is a gem?
Gems are the libraries for ruby. RubyGems is a packing system designed to facilitate the creation, sharing and installation of libraries.

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`
