##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?<br>
The front-end of a website is the part that users interact with. In order to execute user input and build an immersive experience, front-end developers write in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In addition to fluency in these languages, front-end devs need to be familiar with frameworks that will ensure great-looking content no matter the device, and libraries to package code into a more useful, time-saving form. The back-end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. Back-end developemers use server side languages like Ruby to build an application and find/save/change the data that a user inputs then output a response back to the user at the front-end.

Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?
HTML is universal to a browser. When you download Ruby you need to download the interpreter

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

Sign Up for Cloud9 and create a basic Rails project.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

What is an "interpreted" language?<br>
In an interpreted language, the code we write is translated and run through an interpreter which performs the user's desired actions.

What is IRB?<br>
IRB stands for interactive Ruby. It interactively executes whatever Ruby code we write one line at a time.

What are Objects?<br>
Every thing in Ruby is an object. Objects are classified by the characteristics which make up a class of objects. In addition to an objects defining characteristics, you can perform functions/methods on objects.

What are Methods?<br>
Methods, or functions. are a set of instructions bound to an object and have access to its instance variables. You call methods on objects.

What are Classes?<br>
A class is the blueprint for which objects are created. Classes classify objects and each class of object has certain characteristics and functions associated to them.

What are Blocks?<br>
Blocks in Ruby are sets of instructions, placed inside curly braces, which can take arguments and return values and are invoked using a yield statement. They are syntax literals for Proc objects.

What is an Array?<br>
An array is a list of stored information. The list in an array has order. 

What is an Iterator?<br>
An iterator specifies the way a method might go through a collection of objects. Examples of iterators are "each" which returns each value of a collection one by one and "collect" which returns the entire collection of objects.

What are hashes?<br>
A hash, also known as a dictionary, stores pairs of related information. Each data set has a reusable lable to call on it: a key and a value, so as opposed to an array, order in a hash doesn't matter which is why it's like a dictionary that has a vocab word (key) and a definition (value).

What is a library?<br>
Libraries are sets of pre-written functions by a third party that can be downloaded for use and then accessed by calling on them in your own Ruby code.

What is a gem?
The main place where libraries are hosted is RubyGems.org which provides many Ruby libraries released as "gems". Gems are official Ruby library packages that you can download and use in any of your Ruby projects.

Do the challenges at http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0.

Do the RubyMonk “Ruby Primer” course: http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`

####Optional & Resources
 - Read and complete the [Ruby in 100 minutes guide](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby\_in\_100_minutes.html)
 - [Ruby beginners guide](https://hackhands.com/beginners-guide-ruby/)
 - Do the first Ruby exercise (Bob) on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) and respond to any
   feedback you receieve.  Provide a link to your submission on
   Exercism.
