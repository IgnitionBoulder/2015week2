##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?<br>
Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

Sign Up for Cloud9 and create a basic Rails project.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

What is an "interpreted" language?<br>
The intrepreted language allows you to write non machine language and it translates the statements into machine code at run time. 
What is IRB?<br>
Interactive Ruby Shell is the environment for programming in the language Ruby.

What are Objects?<br>
Everything in Ruby is an object. All objects have an identity; they can also hold state and manifest behaviour by responding to messages. These messages are normally dispatched through method calls.

What are Methods?<br>
Ruby methods are used to bundle one or more repeatable statements into a single unit.(Method names should begin with a lowercase letter. If you begin a method name with an uppercase letter, Ruby might think that it is a constant and hence can parse the call incorrectly. Use def and end to declare a method.)

What are Classes?<br>
A class in Ruby always starts with the keyword class followed by the name of the class. The name should always be in initial capitals. It should always be followed by end. A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles.

What are Blocks?<br>
Ruby Code blocks are chunks of code between braces or between do- end that you can associate with methods, almost as if they were parameters. A Ruby block is a way of grouping statements, and may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call; the block is written starting on the same line as the method call's last parameter (or the closing parenthesis of the parameter list). The code in the block is not executed at the time it is encountered. Instead, Ruby remembers the context in which the block appears and then enters the method.

What is an Array?<br>
An array is a list of items. ([x,y,z] format)

What is an Iterator?<br>
Iterators are nothing but methods supported by collections, objects that store a group of data members. In Ruby, arrays and hashes can be termed collections. (the .each is an iterator)

What are hashes?<br>
A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.
example: grades = { "Jane Doe" => 10, "Jim Doe" => 6 }

What is a library?<br>
A library is a collection of precompiled routines that a program can use.

What is a gem?
RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.

Do the challenges at http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0.

Do the RubyMonk “Ruby Primer” course: http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`

####Optional & Resources
 - Read and complete the [Ruby in 100 minutes guide](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby\_in\_100_minutes.html)
 - [Ruby beginners guide](https://hackhands.com/beginners-guide-ruby/)
 - Do the first Ruby exercise (Bob) on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) and respond to any
   feedback you receieve.  Provide a link to your submission on
   Exercism.
