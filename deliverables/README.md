What is the difference between front- and back-end development?<br>
Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

What is an "interpreted" language?<br>
An interpreted language is a language that requires an interpreter to be executed  

What is IRB?<br> 
IRB is a read-eval-print-loop (REPL) for programming in the language Ruby. IRB stands for interactive ruby and can be accessed throgh the Terminal.

What are Objects?<br>
Everything in Ruby is an object, and every expression in Ruby evaluates to an object  

What are Methods?<br>
Ruby methods are very similar to functions in any other programming language. Ruby methods are used to bundle one or more repeatable statements into a single unit. Method names should begin with a lowercase letter.

What are Classes?<br>
Classes act as the factories that build objects. A class in Ruby always starts with the keyword class followed by the name of the class.

What are Blocks?<br>
A block consists of chunks of code, and you assign a name to a block. The code in the block is always enclosed within braces({}).

What is an Array?<br>
Ruby arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object, they are essentially a list of objects. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index.

What is an Iterator?<br>
An iterator is a method that invokes a block of code repeatedly.

What are hashes?<br>
A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values.

What is a library?<br>
Most Ruby libraries are released in the form of a gem. RubyGems is a Ruby packaging system designed to facilitate the creation, sharing and installation of libraries

What is a gem?
Gem's contain package information along with files to install. The gem command is used to build, upload, download, and install Gem packages.

Do the challenges at http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0.

Do the RubyMonk “Ruby Primer” course: http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`
