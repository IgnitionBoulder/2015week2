##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?<br>
Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

Sign Up for Cloud9 and create a basic Rails project.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

**What is an "interpreted" language?<br>**  
Interpreted languages are programming languages that will execute instructions without having to tranlate it into machine code.

**What is IRB?<br>**  
An IRB is a Ruby Shell that wil interact and return execute ruby in live time.

**What are Objects?<br>**  
An object is a variable that can be manipulated in OOP, and is an isntance of a class.

**What are Methods?<br>**  
This is a function that manipulates an object or class.

**What are Classes?<br>**  
A class is a set of functions, often containing many objects.

**What are Blocks?<br>**  
A block is a chunk of code within {braces} or "do" and "end".  This allows you to group methods into one action.

**What is an Array?<br>**  
An array is a collection of objects.  Objects are ordered/indexed so that they can be called upon later.

**What is an Iterator?<br>**  
Iterators are methods that can be executed on collections, or objects that store a group of data members. 

**What are hashes?<br>**  
Hashes are key-value pairs.  They are not stored via indexing, as an array would be.  Essentially, this is a list pairing the "key" object with a correlating "value" property.

**What is a library?<br>**  
This is a collection of methods/commands that can be downloaded, or come with a program, such as Ruby's standard library.

**What is a gem?**  
Gems are how third party libraries are released and shared.

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`
