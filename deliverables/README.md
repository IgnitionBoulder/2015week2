##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?<br>
Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

Sign Up for Cloud9 and create a basic Rails project.

###Intro to Ruby

**What is an "interpreted" language?**<br>
An interpreted language is where most implementations execute instructions directly without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. <br>
**What is IRB?**<br>
IRB stands for "interactive ruby" and allows the user to interactively execute Ruby expressions. <br>
**What are Objects?**<br>
Everything in Ruby is an object. ex: integers, characters, text, arrays, etc. <br>
**What are Methods?**<br>
Methods allow one object to interact with another. <br>
**What are Classes?**<br>
Classes allow the user to use the same method for multiple uses, it basically helps organize methods. <br>
**What are Blocks?**<br>
Blocks are instructions which may take arguments and return values. <br>
**What is an Array?**<br>
Array's are empty containers that are to be filled with objects or data. <br>
**What is an Iterator?**<br>
An iterator is a method that allows you to loop through all of the members of a collection. <br>
**What are hashes?**<br>
Hashes are indexed collections of objects of any type. <br>
**What is a library?**<br>

**What is a gem?**<br>
A gem is made up of a code, a documentation, and a gemspec. <br>
