##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
**What is the difference between front- and back-end development?**<br>
Front end involves materials presented to a user. It is, for the most part, standardized to HTML for markup, CSS for presentation and JavaScript for scripting. Whatever is created in front-end has to be understood by a browser before being presented to a user. With back-end, however, one can run almost anything. Back-end involves working with servers, applications and databases in order to work with user input and information. 

**Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?**<br>
HTML/CSS simply live in the browser so no extra installation is required. With back-end languages such as Ruby, however, installation is required since they involve working, as mentioned earlies, with things like servers and databases that don't simply live in browser.


Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

Sign Up for Cloud9 and create a basic Rails project.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

**What is an "interpreted" language?**<br>
It is a programming language that executes instructions directly, without first compiling a program into machine-language instructions.

**What is IRB?**<br>
Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB) is a REPL (read-eval-print loop) for programming in Ruby.

**What are Objects?**<br>
Objects, in general, are locations in memory that have a value and are referenced by an identifier. Objects can be variables, data structures, functions or even particular instances of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions and data structures.

**What are Methods?**<br>
Methods are procedures associated with object classes. They represent the behaviour of objects and are also the interface an object presents on the outside.

**What are Classes?**<br>
Classes are program code templates used to create objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behaviour.

**What are Blocks?**<br>
Blocks are regions containing definitions of variables that delimit the regions where these definitions apply.

**What is an Array?**<br>
An Array is a series of objects which are of the same size and type. Each object in an array is called an array element.

**What is an Iterator?**<br>
An Iterator is an object that enables traversing of containers, particularly lists.

**What are hashes?**<br>
Hashes store related information by giving reusable labels to pieces of our data. Hashes simply pair up two things: a key and a value. 

**What is a library?**<br>
A library is a collection of precompiled routines/modules that a program can use. These routines/modules are stored in object format.

**What is a gem?**<br>
A gem is a package manager for Ruby that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries.


Do the challenges at http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0.

Do the RubyMonk “Ruby Primer” course: http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`

####Optional & Resources
 - Read and complete the [Ruby in 100 minutes guide](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby\_in\_100_minutes.html)
 - [Ruby beginners guide](https://hackhands.com/beginners-guide-ruby/)
 - Do the first Ruby exercise (Bob) on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) and respond to any
   feedback you receieve.  Provide a link to your submission on
