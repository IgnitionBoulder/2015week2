What is the difference between front- and back-end development?<br>
Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

What is an "interpreted" language?<br>
An interpreted language is a programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.<br>
What is IRB?<br>
Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB or irb) is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby. The abbreviation irb comes from the fact that the filename extension for Ruby is ".rb", although interactive Ruby files do not have an extension of ".irb".<br>
What are Objects?<br>
Objects are instances of the class.<br>
What are Methods?<br>
Ruby methods are very similar to functions in any other programming language. Ruby methods are used to bundle one or more repeatable statements into a single unit.<br>
What are Classes?<br>
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.<br>
What are Blocks?<br>
A block is code that you can store in a variable like any other object and run on demand.<br>
What is an Array?<br>
An array is a list of items in order.<br>
What is an Iterator?<br>
An iterator is something that does the same thing many times such as a loop.<br>
What are hashes?<br>
Hashes are similar to arrays in that they are indexed collection of object references.<br>
What is a library?<br>
Sources used to write Ruby code.<br>
What is a gem?<br>
RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.<br>
