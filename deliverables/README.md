##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?<br>
Front-end development is the part of the code that is visible to the user and interacts with them. The back-end development is the part of the code that is never visible to the user and interacts with the server.  

Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?  
HTML and CSS are part of the browser and are necessary for the front end of projects. Things like Ruby are accessed from the back and and therefore need to be installed in order to access the server.  


Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

Sign Up for Cloud9 and create a basic Rails project.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

What is an "interpreted" language?<br>
An interpreted language is a programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly.  

What is IRB?<br>
Interactive Ruby shell.  

What are Objects?<br>
Objects are individual components of a class.    

What are Methods?<br>
Methods group one or more repeatable statements together.  

What are Classes?<br>
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.  

What are Blocks?<br>
A block is a section of code contained within braces.  

What is an Array?<br>
An array is an unordered, integer-indexed collection.
ex: array = [1, 2, 3, 4] to access: arr[1..2]  

What is an Iterator?<br>
An iterator is a method that can invoke a block of code.  

What are hashes?<br>
A hash is a collection of key-value pairs. Hashes (sometimes known as associative arrays or dictionaries) are similar to arrays, in that they are indexed collectives of object references.
ex: hash = {a:1, b:30} (all keys have to be different). to access: h[:a] = 5  

What is a library?<br>
A library is a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.  

What is a gem?
A gem is a package of information along with files to install.  

Do the challenges at http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0.

Do the RubyMonk “Ruby Primer” course: http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`

####Optional & Resources
 - Read and complete the [Ruby in 100 minutes guide](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby\_in\_100_minutes.html)
 - [Ruby beginners guide](https://hackhands.com/beginners-guide-ruby/)
 - Do the first Ruby exercise (Bob) on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) and respond to any
   feedback you receieve.  Provide a link to your submission on
