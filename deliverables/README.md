##Week 2: Introduction to Ruby
###Intro to the Back End
####Required
What is the difference between front- and back-end development?<br>
Why do you need to install Ruby but not HTML/CSS?

Read the [intro to back end on the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/introduction-to-the-back-end) description, and the [What is: Back-end web development](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-back-end-web-development/) blog post.

Sign Up for Cloud9 and create a basic Rails project.

###Intro to Ruby
####Required

**What is an "interpreted" language?**  An interpreted language is a programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.<br>


**What is IRB?**  Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB or irb) is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby.<br>


**What are Objects?**  Everything in Ruby is an object, All objects have an identity; they can also hold state and manifest behaviour by responding to messages. These messages are normally dispatched through method calls. <br>


**What are Methods?**  Ruby methods are very similar to functions in any other programming language. Ruby methods are used to bundle one or more repeatable statements into a single unit.<br>


**What are Classes?**  An object-oriented program involves classes and objects. A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles.<br>


**What are Blocks?**   Blocks are just chunks of code that you can pick up and drop into another method as an input. They're often called "anonymous functions" because they have no name but behave much like functions.<br>


**What is an Array?**  An Array is just a list of items in order (like mangoes, apples, and oranges). Every slot in the list acts like a variable: you can see what object a particular slot points to, and you can make it point to a different object.<br>


**What is an Iterator?**  Iterators are not an original concept with ruby. They are in common use in object-oriented languages. They are also used in Lisp, though there they are not called iterators. However the concept of iterator is an unfamiliar one for many so it should be explained in more detail.<br>


**What are hashes?**  A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.<br>


**What is a library?**  The main place where libraries are hosted is RubyGems.org, providing Ruby libs as gems. You may browse the website directly, or use the gem command. Using gem search -r , you can inspect RubyGems' repository. For instance, gem search -r rails will return a list of Rails-related gems.<br>


**What is a gem?** It is a way to transport ruby files. 

Do the challenges at http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0.

Do the RubyMonk “Ruby Primer” course: http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1

###Weekly Project
You need to complete all the problems on the RubyMonk ([starting with this one](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/problems/9-calculator)) and upload them to your deliverables Github Repo in the RubyMonk folder. If you get stuck, refer to the GitHub information in the [Odin project’s walkthrough](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

Put each problem solution into the appropriate file in `ruby_monk_problems`

####Optional & Resources
 - Read and complete the [Ruby in 100 minutes guide](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby\_in\_100_minutes.html)
 - [Ruby beginners guide](https://hackhands.com/beginners-guide-ruby/)
 - Do the first Ruby exercise (Bob) on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) and respond to any
   feedback you receieve.  Provide a link to your submission on
   Exercism.
